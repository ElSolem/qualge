# Quantum Algebra Example Library

This repository showcases an example library for a **quantum-inspired pathfinding system**, including the implementation of the quantum algebraic approach and related visualizations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **quantum algebraic principles** can be applied to classical pathfinding algorithms—such as the **A\*** algorithm—to improve scalability and efficiency.

The core idea revolves around a **quantum initialization method** that prepares the search space dynamically, leading to enhanced performance, especially in large-scale grid environments.

### 📦 What's Included

- **🔍 Pathfinder Code**: Python implementation of the quantum algebraic pathfinding method.
- **📊 Graph Visualizations**: Plots and graphs (via `matplotlib`, `numpy`, etc.) to visualize the impact of quantum equality on pathfinding behavior.
- **🖼️ New Symbolic Visuals**: A suite of 2D and 3D plots representing the symbolic architecture of quantum algebra structures, including:
  - Polymetron Grid (Flat)
  - Inverse Grid (3D structure)
  - Chaos-to-Order Flow with Thrones (Ikigai core logic)

> ⚠️ This project is intended as a **demonstration only** and is not an actively maintained development effort.
